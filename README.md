PROJECT OVERVIEW
Our project is a ngo/charity linking and exapnding website where we allow people to know more about charitites around their locality giving them chances to 
explore and participate in charity events and even allow them to donate as now they have ready access to ngo organizations and charities present around them
it is a newer way to do good and socialise to build real connections with people with the same intentions and build a network big enough to give back to the society
